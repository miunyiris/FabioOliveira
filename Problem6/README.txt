# Score Service API Module

## Overview

This API module is designed to handle the score management of a website's leaderboard, which displays the top 10 user scores. The module ensures real-time updates to the leaderboard as users complete actions that increase their scores. It also includes security measures to prevent unauthorized score modifications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: The leaderboard is updated live with the most recent user scores.
- **Score Increase**: User scores are updated when an action is completed.
- **Score Retrieval**: Provides access to the current top 10 scores.
- **Security**: Implements various security measures to prevent unauthorized score updates.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Update Score

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/scores/update`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Updates a user's score. This endpoint should be called when a user completes an action that increases their score.

#### Request Parameters

- `user_id` (string): Unique identifier for the user.
- `score` (integer): The score value to be added.
- `token` (string): Authorization token to validate the request.

#### Response

- **Success (200 OK)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Score updated successfully"
    }
    ```
- **Failure (400 Bad Request)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "Invalid input or authorization failure"
    }
    ```
- **Unauthorized (401 Unauthorized)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "Invalid authorization token"
    }
    ```
- **Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "An unexpected error occurred"
    }
    ```

### 2. Retrieve Scores

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/scores`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Retrieves the current top 10 scores from the leaderboard.

#### Response

- **Success (200 OK)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": [
        { "user_id": "user1", "score": 1200 },
        { "user_id": "user2", "score": 1150 },
        { "user_id": "user3", "score": 1100 },
        // ... more users
      ]
    }
    ```
- **Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "An unexpected error occurred"
    }
    ```

## Authorization and Security

- **Authorization Token**: Each request to update scores must include a valid token to verify the user's identity and ensure they have permission to update their score.
- **Rate Limiting**: The API should limit the number of score updates allowed per minute per user to prevent abuse.
- **Input Validation**: All incoming data must be validated to ensure correct data types and prevent injection attacks.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: All score updates should be logged, and suspicious activity should trigger alerts for further investigation.

## Live Update Mechanism

- **WebSocket**: The server uses WebSocket to push real-time updates to connected clients. This ensures that the leaderboard reflects the latest scores without requiring page reloads.
- **Polling (Fallback)**: If WebSocket is not available, a polling mechanism will be implemented as a fallback to periodically fetch the latest scores from the server.

## Error Handling

- **Invalid User ID**: The server returns a 400 Bad Request if the user ID is invalid or not found.
- **Invalid Token**: The server returns a 401 Unauthorized if the authorization token is invalid or expired.
- **Unexpected Errors**: The server returns a 500 Internal Server Error if any unexpected issue occurs during the score update process.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Token Expiry Management**: Implement token expiry handling and renewal to enhance security.
2. **Caching Mechanism**: Introduce caching for frequently accessed data to improve the performance of leaderboard retrieval.
3. **Score History**: Consider adding a feature to maintain and display a user's score history.
4. **Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert users when they enter or drop out of the top 10 leaderboard.
